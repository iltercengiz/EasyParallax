# EasyParallax

This project demonstrates easily implementing a parallax view with zero code using `UIScrollView` and `UIStackView` to manage contents. Just take a look at the Main.storyboard file and by creating the same auto layout constraints, you can also have a parallax view implemented only using IB.

## Implementation details

**TODO**
